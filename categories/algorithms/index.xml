      <description>Even something as simple as a dropdown menu or a bar graph can introduce usability problems. From a slide out menu disappearing when a user&amp;rsquo;s mouse moves a few pixels too far, to requiring NASA-like levels of precision to mouse over the right element, there are algorithms already implemented in Javascript to help us overcome these problems. If an algorithm is defined as &amp;ldquo;a step-by-step procedure for calculations&amp;rdquo;, let&amp;rsquo;s visually break down those steps for 2 different non-trivial algorithms and explore how these algorithms are applied to some standard &amp;amp; everyday user interface patterns.</description>
