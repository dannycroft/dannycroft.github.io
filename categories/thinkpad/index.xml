      <description>I recently purchased a ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop. My OS choice is Linux and Ubuntu 14.04 works flawlessly on this particular laptop.
For a quick win when trying to get the most battery life out of a full charge install TLP.
 TLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux without the need to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with a default configuration already optimized for battery life, so you may just install and forget it.</description>
