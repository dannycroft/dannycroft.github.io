      <description>This past month I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a few people that didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the Debug menu that is available in Safari. Granted, for most engineers it won&amp;rsquo;t be of any use, but for some it will be invaluable.
 Open up the terminal (Mac OSX) Enter the following and hit enter: defaults write com.apple.Safari -IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 Restart/Open Safari  Note: This can be undone by changing 1 to 0 in the above command followed by a restart of Safari.</description>

      <description>So as you may already know, Firebug must be one of the most important tools a developer can have in their utility belt.
The more I use Firebug, the more I realise that I&amp;rsquo;m not using it to its full potential. One of the most useful aspects of Firebug is its ability to help me debug code fast.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how many developers out there have Firebug installed, but when debugging JavaScript always resort to using the alert(); function.</description>
