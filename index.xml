      <title>Set default brightness on Ubuntu</title>

      <guid>https://www.dannycroft.co.uk/set-default-brightness-on-ubuntu/</guid>
      <description>I use a Thinkpad laptop with Linux installed for most of my work these days. However, with Ubuntu 14.04, the brightness always resets to maximum when I restart. This gets annoying, especially if you boot your laptop up in a dark room.
The easiest way I found to set my brightness was to use the xbacklight package:
sudo apt-get install xbacklight
Now you can set the brightness easily to a certain percentage via the command line: xbacklight -set 50</description>

      <description>Global: npm ls -g --depth=0 2&amp;gt;/dev/null  Project: npm ls --depth=0 2&amp;gt;/dev/null
You can drop the 2&amp;gt;/dev/null redirection but then you won&amp;rsquo;t get a cleaner list of packages. You will also get any NPM ERR! that currently exist.</description>

      <description>Press Enter , ~ , . one after the other to disconnect from a frozen session. Simple but effective.
This works because these are escape sequences. Next time you SSH somewhere just type ~ and ? (tilde, then question mark) to see all the options.
Supported escape sequences:
~. - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)
~B - send a BREAK to the remote system
~C - open a command line</description>

      <guid>https://www.dannycroft.co.uk/short-screen-casting-with-gifs-ubuntu/</guid>
      <description>To record short screencasts on Ubuntu I use byzanz. Byzanz is a desktop recorder and command line tool allowing you to record your current desktop or parts of it to an animated GIF, Ogg Theora, Flash or WebM.
To install:
sudo apt-get install byzanz
To use: (with 5 second delay)
byzanz-record --delay=5 --duration=10 --x=878 --width=722 --height=434 ~/Desktop/vim.gif
or an alternative syntax: (using both X and Y)
byzanz-record -d 10 -x 878 -y 200 -w 722 -h 434 ~/Desktop/vim.</description>

      <description>I recently purchased a ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop. My OS choice is Linux and Ubuntu 14.04 works flawlessly on this particular laptop.
For a quick win when trying to get the most battery life out of a full charge install TLP.
 TLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux without the need to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with a default configuration already optimized for battery life, so you may just install and forget it.</description>

      <description>Using Git and just applied the wrong stash? No worries, the following will help you.
Unapply the last stash: → git stash show -p | git apply -R
Unapply a specific stash: e.g. 0 in this case → git stash show -p stash@{0} | git apply -R</description>

      <description>My tmux session crashed, including a local server instance I was running. Now when I try to restart the server I get an error saying it&amp;rsquo;s still running? How do I kill it?
 You probably already know what port you were using, so find what&amp;rsquo;s listening on that port, collect it&amp;rsquo;s PID and then kill it:
Find the PID of what&amp;rsquo;s running on port 9292 using lsof: → lsof -i:9292 -t 58085</description>

      <description>Even something as simple as a dropdown menu or a bar graph can introduce usability problems. From a slide out menu disappearing when a user&amp;rsquo;s mouse moves a few pixels too far, to requiring NASA-like levels of precision to mouse over the right element, there are algorithms already implemented in Javascript to help us overcome these problems. If an algorithm is defined as &amp;ldquo;a step-by-step procedure for calculations&amp;rdquo;, let&amp;rsquo;s visually break down those steps for 2 different non-trivial algorithms and explore how these algorithms are applied to some standard &amp;amp; everyday user interface patterns.</description>

      <description>Update: Google have now compiled a solid walkthrough that can be see here: Debugging JavaScript - Source Maps
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a couple of posts about enabling source map support, but never actually got it up and running. Below are the steps that I took to achieve this. I use Google Chrome in my development workflow and almost all of the time it&amp;rsquo;s the Canary variation. The (latest) version I&amp;rsquo;m currently using is &amp;ldquo;Version 26.</description>

      <guid>https://www.dannycroft.co.uk/how-to-enable-the-safari-debug-menu/</guid>
      <description>This past month I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a few people that didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the Debug menu that is available in Safari. Granted, for most engineers it won&amp;rsquo;t be of any use, but for some it will be invaluable.
 Open up the terminal (Mac OSX) Enter the following and hit enter: defaults write com.apple.Safari -IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 Restart/Open Safari  Note: This can be undone by changing 1 to 0 in the above command followed by a restart of Safari.</description>

      <description>Last year Google proposed the Web Intents API to help web applications integrate with one another with minimal effort. They have now enabled an experimental version of the API in the most recent stable version of Chrome.

      <description>Update (20/09/2014): I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the following walkthrough because people are still using it. It was originally written back in 2012 and parts of it were really out of date e.g. almost all the installation process can now be replaced with &amp;ldquo;npm i -g casperjs phantomjs&amp;rdquo; (we have npm now, yay!). Give me a shout if something is still out of date. If you&amp;rsquo;ve commented (thank you &amp;lt;3) but your comments keep disappearing, that&amp;rsquo;s my bad and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.</description>

I decided that what I really could do with was a simple way of finding out what gigs and concerts are on near me. So using the data kindly provided by Songkick (thanks guys!) I went ahead and built just that.</description>

      <description>I use the W3C Unicorn Validator for almost all my markup validation needs. However every time I need to validate something I almost always end up googling &amp;ldquo;W3C Unicorn&amp;rdquo;. Which I admit is still pretty fast, but I wanted to cut as much faff out of that process as possible.
So today (as in just this minute), I made a JavaScript bookmarklet that will help me trim the fat as it were.</description>

      <description>So as you may already know, Firebug must be one of the most important tools a developer can have in their utility belt.
The more I use Firebug, the more I realise that I&amp;rsquo;m not using it to its full potential. One of the most useful aspects of Firebug is its ability to help me debug code fast.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how many developers out there have Firebug installed, but when debugging JavaScript always resort to using the alert(); function.</description>

The problem is, is that I always forget when the games I want to watch are on.</description>

      <description>Today, like many others I have been following the terrible aftermath of the Haiti Earthquake. After listening to a particularly hard hitting Radio 4 broadcast and learning that a massive array of charities around the world needed donations and support to help provide relief to Haiti, I hunted down the fastest way to make a donation.
Being halfway through the daily commute to work I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my wallet on me, so I found it incredibly difficult to find a charity online that excepted donations for Haiti relief support via PayPal (PayPal have all my details stored online).</description>
