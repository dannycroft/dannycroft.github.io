      <description>Update (20/09/2014): I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the following walkthrough because people are still using it. It was originally written back in 2012 and parts of it were really out of date e.g. almost all the installation process can now be replaced with &amp;ldquo;npm i -g casperjs phantomjs&amp;rdquo; (we have npm now, yay!). Give me a shout if something is still out of date. If you&amp;rsquo;ve commented (thank you &amp;lt;3) but your comments keep disappearing, that&amp;rsquo;s my bad and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.</description>
